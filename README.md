---

## 🔄 **4. Complete Workflow / Pipelines**

Here’s how the system flows from start to finish 👇

---

### **Step 1: Resume Upload (Input Layer)**

* **User Action:** Uploads a PDF/DOCX/TXT resume via the Streamlit interface.
* **Process:** File is temporarily saved in the backend.
* **Purpose:** Input document for analysis.

📦 **Output:** `resume_path`

---

### **Step 2: Resume Parsing & Summarization**

* **Node:** `node_parse_resume` + `node_summary`

* **Tools Used:**

  * `PdfReader` / `python-docx` for text extraction
  * **Groq API (LLaMA-3)** for summarization

* **Functions:**

  * Extracts raw text from resume.
  * Generates:

    * Short professional summary
    * List of normalized skills
    * Key achievements/projects

📦 **Output:**

```json
{
  "summary": "Data Analyst with strong Python and ML foundation.",
  "skills": ["Python", "SQL", "Pandas", "Tableau"]
}
```

---

### **Step 3: Profile Extraction**

* **Node:** `node_profile`
* **Tool:** Groq LLM
* **Purpose:** Convert unstructured resume into structured JSON data.
* **Output Fields:**

  * Name
  * Skills
  * Experience
  * Education
  * Target roles
  * Locations

📦 **Output:**

```json
{
  "name": "Ranjan Kumar Yadav",
  "skills": ["Python", "SQL", "Machine Learning", "AWS"],
  "target_roles": ["Data Analyst", "ML Engineer"]
}
```

---

### **Step 4: Job Search (Real-Time Data)**

* **Node:** `node_search`
* **Tool:** `JSearch API` (RapidAPI)
* **Query:** Uses candidate’s **skills + target roles**
* **Output:** Raw job list (title, company, location, description, link)

📦 **Output:**

```json
[
  {"title": "Data Analyst", "company": "Accenture", "location": "Bengaluru", "link": "..."},
  {"title": "ML Engineer", "company": "Google", "location": "Hyderabad", "link": "..."}
]
```

---

### **Step 5: Job Ranking (Matching Pipeline)**

* **Node:** `node_rank`

* **Tools:**

  * Hugging Face embeddings: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
  * NumPy for cosine similarity

* **Working:**

  1. Converts candidate profile & job descriptions to vectors.
  2. Calculates similarity between them.
  3. Sorts and returns top 10–12 relevant jobs.

📦 **Output:**
Top jobs ranked by semantic similarity.

---

### **Step 6: Skill Gap Analysis**

* **Node:** `node_gaps`
* **Tool:** Groq LLM
* **Process:**

  * Compares the candidate’s skills vs job requirements.
  * Identifies missing or weak skills.
  * Suggests “quick wins” (skills learnable in <30 days).

📦 **Output:**

```json
{
  "gaps": ["Power BI", "Docker"],
  "easiest_wins": ["Tableau dashboard creation"]
}
```

---

### **Step 7: 90-Day Career Roadmap**

* **Node:** `node_roadmap`
* **Tool:** Groq LLM
* **Purpose:** Generates a learning roadmap to fill skill gaps and build a portfolio.

📦 **Output Example:**

> **Weeks 1–4:** Strengthen SQL & Data Visualization
> **Weeks 5–8:** Build an ML project on Kaggle
> **Weeks 9–12:** Deploy Streamlit app on cloud

---

### **Step 8: Job Recommendation Explanation**

* **Node:** `node_brief`
* **Tool:** Groq LLM
* **Purpose:** Generates human-style explanation for job matches.
* **Input:** Profile + top-ranked jobs
* **Output:** Concise paragraph summarizing “Why these jobs?”

📦 **Example:**

> Based on Ranjan’s experience with Python, SQL, and cloud tools, Data Analyst and ML roles are an excellent fit. The jobs emphasize analytics and cloud-based dashboards — matching his strengths and learning goals.

---

### **Step 9: Streamlit Visualization (Frontend)**

* Left Panel:

  * Resume Summary
  * Skill Gaps
  * Roadmap
* Right Panel:

  * Job Cards (title, company, link)
  * “Why These Jobs” analysis

📦 **Final Output (UI):**

| Section                | Description                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 📄 Resume Summary      | AI-generated overview of candidate |
| 🛠️ Skill Gaps         | Weak or missing skills             |

## 🧮 **5. LangGraph Workflow**

LangGraph manages all pipeline steps as connected nodes:

```
parse_resume → summary → profile → search_jobs 
→ rank_jobs → skill_gaps → roadmap → brief → END
```

Each node:

* Takes `state` (input dictionary)
* Returns updates
* Passes merged state to next node

✅ Handles:

* Step-by-step logic
* State persistence
* Smooth chaining
* Automatic flow control
